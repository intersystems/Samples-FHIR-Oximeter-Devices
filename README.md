# Tracking Patient Care Using FHIR

In this exercise, you will modify an existing InterSystems IRIS for Health™ system to monitor incoming HL7® FHIR® data from a smart device connected to a Bluetooth oximeter. You will see how InterSystems IRIS for Health acts as a decision support tool, sending HL7 V2 requests to other applications based on parameters that are tracked by the Bluetooth device.

See instructions for *[Tracking Patient Care Using FHIR](https://learning.intersystems.com/course/view.php?name=FHIROximeter)* exercise on the [InterSystems Learning site](https://learning.intersystems.com/).
